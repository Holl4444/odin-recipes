# Create a Simple Website

Put HTML reading into action by building a basic website of recipes, following
guidelines from The Odin Project.

This project allowed me to practice using the *<a>* tag for both absolute and
relative links, adding images and employing ordered and unordered lists.
You can find the project at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

Coming back to this project I've added some simple styling to practice CSS.
