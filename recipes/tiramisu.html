        <li>Mascarpone - 250g</li>
        <li>Marsala - 75 ml</li>
        <li>Golden caster sugar - 5 tbsp</li>
        <li>Sponge fingers - 175g</li>
        <li>Dark chocolate - 25g</li>
        <li>Cocoa powder - 2 tspn</li>
        <li>Coffee</li>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>Coffee granules - 2 tbsp</li>
            <li>Boiling water - 300 ml </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the double cream, mascarpone, marsala and golden caster sugar in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk until the cream and mascarpone have completely combined and have the consistency of thickly whipped cream.</li>
        <li>Pour the coffee into a shallow dish. Dip in a few of the sponge fingers at a time, turning for a few seconds until they are nicely soaked, but not soggy. Layer these in a dish until you&CloseCurlyQuote;ve used half the sponge fingers, then spread over half of the creamy mixture.</li>
        <li>Using the coarse side of the grater, grate over most of the dark chocolate. Then repeat the layers (you should use up all the coffee), finishing with the creamy layer.</li>
        <li>Cover and chill for a few hours or overnight. Will keep in the fridge for up to two days.</li>
        <li>To serve, dust with the cocoa powder and grate over the remainder of the chocolate.</li>
    </ol>
